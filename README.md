# Wayland Fabric Touch Support For Minecraft
Additional mod for TouchController for wayland native touch support! 

## What is it?
This is additional mod for TouchController for wayland linux. 
So, wayland version of Minecraft doesn't natively supports touch input for GUI. But this mod adds this! It's highly recommended to use it alongside with TouchController, beacuse at the moment this mod doesn't have buttons for movement, flying, etc. (all what adds TouchContoller). 
But, it's still possible to run this  mo without touchcontroller. 

## Features
1. GUI touch input support.
2. Flexible settings for touchscreen and screen.
3. Debug red dots for checking where click actually happens

## Bugs
1. Only fullscreen mode works :(

## Installation

### 3. Enjoy!
